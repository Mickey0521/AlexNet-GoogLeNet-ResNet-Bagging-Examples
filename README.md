# AlexNet-GoogLeNet-ResNet-Bagging-Examples

1. AlexNet.py: the independent source code of AlexNet 
2. GoogLeNet.py: the independent source code of GoogLeNet 
3. ResNet.py: the independent source code of ResNet 
4. VGG.py:  the independent source code of VGG 

5. real_project_gender_recognition_AlexNet_GoogLeNet_ResNet_demo.ipynb:
a real project to demo how to use AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet in gender recognition 
(demo how to use AlexNet.py, GoogLeNet.py, ResNet.py, and VGG.py)

6. real_project_use_pre_trained_models_Bagging_demo.ipynb:
a real project to demo how to use Bagging (with pre-trained AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet) in gender recognition 

Please note that:

i. we did not provide the dataset, but you can use any data (i.e., any pictures), to run our demo.ipynb. 

ii. we did not provide the pre-trained models (because they are way too big), but you can use our source code to train AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.
